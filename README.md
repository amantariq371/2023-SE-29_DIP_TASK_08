Image Restoration (Task 08)

This Python program performs image restoration on a user-uploaded grayscale image. It simulates common image degradations including Gaussian noise, Salt & Pepper noise, and Motion Blur, and restores them using Wiener filtering and Median filtering. The program computes PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for each restoration method to evaluate quality, and displays the original, degraded, and restored images side by side. This allows users to compare results and identify the most effective restoration technique for each type of noise.

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-image
